Here are some examples of .bash scripts that I have written over the years.

- ann : a simple demonstration of wget, HTML parsing, a pattern replacement

 usage: ./ann
- run : a testing script that checks expected output for any C++ programs

 usage: ./run [compiled c++ program file] tests.txt
 
 where tests.txt is a file that contains the file names of all input files, seperated by newline.
